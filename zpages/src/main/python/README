The Python Client requires the following libraries

- Flask (0.12+) https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask/0.12
  which can be installed via:
  > pip install Flask

- gRPC Python library http://www.grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/python.html
  which can be installed via:

Both libraries, and their dependencies are required to run the mode
front-end service.
